This code suffers from a common issue in Haskell: it attempts to pattern match on a value that might not be in the expected form, leading to a runtime error.

```haskell
import Data.Maybe

data MyData = MyData { field1 :: Int, field2 :: Maybe String }

process :: MyData -> Int
process (MyData x y) = case y of
  Just z  -> x + read z
  Nothing -> x
```

The problem arises if `field2` in `MyData` is `Nothing`.  While the `case` statement handles `Nothing`, attempting to `read z` when `z` is not a valid number will raise an error.  If `z` contains non-numeric characters or is an empty string, `read z` will fail.
